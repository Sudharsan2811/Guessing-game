# Guessing-game
This project implements a number guessing game using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The project includes two versions of the game:

1.User Guessing Game: The user tries to guess a randomly selected number by the program.
2.Machine Guessing Game: The user thinks of a number, and the machine guesses it based on feedback from the user.
Features
User Guessing Game:

The user is asked to guess a randomly generated number within a range they define.
The game gives feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
The game keeps track of the number of attempts.
Machine Guessing Game:

The user thinks of a number within a specified range.
The machine uses binary search to guess the user's number based on feedback from the user (whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct).
The game keeps track of the machine's attempts to guess the number.
